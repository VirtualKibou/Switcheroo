    Tearing through the sky
    Resplendent

    I see the beauty
    The Phoenix perches
    It hurts. But I will heal

    I am her only friend

    My desire

    "Sad Thoughts"
    I pop my scalp off the top of my head like the lid of a cookie jar. 
    It's time to clean up in there.
    Happy Thoughts and Angry Thoughts
    All wriggling in the dark crevices of my mind.
    The Happy Thoughts are soft and warm. They rub against each other like a bundle of kittens.
    The Angry Thoughts are prickly to the touch. The prickles dig into my head and become stuck.
    The Angry Thoughts are mean to the Happy Thoughts
    They never get along
    So I pluck out the Happy Thoughts.
    Since the Angry Thoughts are way too strong
    I put the Happy Thoughts into bottles
    Where they stay safe and sound.
    I keep them all up on a shelf
    For when my friends come into town.
    The Angry Thoughts get stronger.
    The prickles then grow longer.
    Angry Thoughts, Angry Thoughts, Angry Thoughts
    In my head, they glow.
    The Happy Thoughts, they tingle
    Their numbers begin to dwindle
    Happy Thoughts, Happy Thoughts, Happy Thoughts
    In bottles all in a row.
    Night after night, more dreams
    Dream after Dream, more bottles
    Deeper and deeper my fingers go
    Searching all the nooks and crannies
    The Angry Thoughts eventually die
    But when they do, they become hard and cold.
    I don't like the way they feel.
    Sad Thoughts, Sad Thoughts, Sad Thoughts.
    Forever embedded in my mind.
    Dust settles onto my bottle caps
    It doesn't feel like time elapsed
    I check my head, but find no more
    My friends look through my locked front door
    I open the door and in they come.
    Do they really want my bottles that bad?
    I pull them down from the shelf and give them to each one of my friends.
    Each one of my bottles.
    But when I let the bottles go, they slip out of my hands and shatter on the tile between my feet.
    Happy Thoughts, Happy Thoughts, Happy Thoughts 
    In shards all over the floor
    Angry Thoughts, Angry Thoughts, Angry Thoughts
    Banging on my door
    Sad Thoughts, Sad Thoughts, Sad Thoughts
    Eating at my core
    My friends are yelling. Pleading.
    My heart is pounding. Bleeding.
    I want the Angry Thoughts to go away.
    I want the Happy Thoughts instead.
    But all I hear are the Sad Thoughts going
    Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
    On repeat, inside my head.

    "Play Me"
    Your colors, though bright and beautiful, blind me 
    Red, green, blue
    They flash;  expanding     across     the     universe
    They won't stop 
    Your noise 
    is endlessly meaningless
    It squeaks violently; screeching    across                 time    
    Piercing 
    through my ears
    Sine, cosine, tangent
    An endless cacophony 
    of  grating  waveforms
    
    Like dragging a fork across a dinner plate
                Like playing a vinyl on a pizza crust

    An endless 
    Poem 
    of meaningless








    Quit Me
